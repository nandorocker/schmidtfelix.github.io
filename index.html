<p>I am an extraverted, assertive and energetic thinker. I love a good challenge and firmly believe that given enough time and resources anything is possible. I enjoy thinking outside of the box and working on a broad spectrum of tasks.

I am curious and welcome different opinions. I want to go out and experience things, even if I have to step out of my comfort zone to do so. Most people would describe me as imaginative and open-minded person with a sometimes infectious enthusiasm and solid determination.

Sometimes you need to rest. In my case that means climbing up difficult rock faces or just generally being outside doing some kind of outdoor activity. Because I’m more of the sunny type person you’ll find me inside if it is raining, reading up on something or focused on a small artsy drawing session.</p>
